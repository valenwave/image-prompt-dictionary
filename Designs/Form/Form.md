## [Dark Form]

### ðŸŽ¯ Subject Identification
* **Subject:** "Void-Heart Berserker"
* **Classification:** [Character]
* **Justification:** The character is the sole subject and focal point, defined by his powerful, energy-emanating presence against a dark backdrop.

### ðŸ”¬ Deconstructed Analysis
* **Core Concept:** A male anime protagonist consumed by or manifesting a powerful shadow and cosmic energy, with a glowing core at his heart.
* **Anatomy & Form:** Lean, athletic male humanoid physique. The body is presented as a silhouette, but its surface is cracked and flaking, with inky black tendrils of shadow energy peeling away and dissipating. The face is obscured in darkness, featuring only intensely glowing eyes. The hair is spiky and sharp, characteristic of shonen anime protagonists.
* **Material & Texture:** The body appears to be made of solid, matte black shadow, like obsidian or solidified darkness. This is contrasted by veins of crackling purple energy that run across the torso, originating from a central core. The surrounding aura consists of wispy, smoky tendrils and a particulate, nebula-like cosmic dust.
* **Color Palette:** A simple, high-contrast palette. The dominant color is **void black**. The secondary and accent colors are shades of **vibrant electric purple**, **luminous magenta**, and hints of **pure white** at the brightest points of energy (the core and eyes).
* **Attachments & Gear:** None. The character is completely unadorned, with his power being an intrinsic part of his being.
* **Artistic Style:** Modern action anime/manga style. It features high-contrast digital illustration with sharp lines, dynamic energy effects, and a focus on dramatic lighting. The style is reminiscent of popular dark fantasy webtoons and shonen series.
* **Lighting:** The primary light source is internal. A brilliant, star-like energy core in the center of the chest casts a powerful purple glow, illuminating the torso from within and creating a complex pattern of light on the dark surface. The eyes are a secondary internal light source. The entire figure is backlit by a swirling purple cosmic aura.
* **Composition:** A powerful, symmetrical bust shot. The character is centered in the frame, facing the viewer directly with a slightly tensed, assertive posture, creating a sense of immense, contained power.
