# Rings

## [Steel Ring]

Figure: The ring is a wide, solid band with a substantial thickness. Its primary material is Damascus steel, identifiable by the characteristic wavy, layered patterns etched into the metal's surface, which are visible on both the exterior and interior. The overall color is a dark, matte charcoal gray. The most striking feature is an offset, diagonal groove that cuts across the band, creating a modern, asymmetrical split design where one side appears to overlap the other.
Accessory: Set within the diagonal groove is an inlay with an iridescent, multicolored quality, showing flashes of blue, purple, and pink, similar in appearance to opal or abalone shell. On the face of the overlapping section of the band, a small, round, dark gemstone (possibly a black diamond or onyx) is flush-set in a polished, silvery bezel.

## [Polished Ring]

The ring is constructed from several distinct components. The main body is a polished black metal, likely tungsten or titanium, known for its scratch resistance. The central inlay consists of two parts: a background of fragmented, shimmering red material mixed with darker, almost black, elements, giving it a crushed gemstone or volcanic rock appearance. Overlaid on this red background is a repeating silver or white pattern of an intricate, interwoven design reminiscent of a Celtic dragon or knotwork.
