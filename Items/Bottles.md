# Bottles

## [Blue Bottle]

Stunningly ornate bottle, designed with a powerful fantasy or magical theme.

Design: The clear glass bottle is encased in beautiful metalwork crafted to look like a tree. The "roots" form the base, and the trunk and branches spread up and around the bulbous body.

Contents: Inside, the bottle holds a glowing, ethereal substance. It's a vibrant blue, filled with what looks like luminous bubbles or orbs of light. There is a warm, golden glow at the bottom, suggesting the tree is drawing up a magical energy.

Aesthetic: The overall theme strongly evokes magic, nature, and life. It looks like a "mana potion," an "Elixir of Life," or a container for a sacred, natural power that you might find in a fantasy world or a video game like The Legend of Zelda or The Witcher.
Like the previous red decanter, this image is likely a piece of digital art or a highly detailed 3D render, designed to capture a sense of wonder and magic.

## [Red Bottle]

A highly ornate decanter or bottle.

The bottle features a bulbous body made of vibrant red glass. It is encased in intricate, gold-colored filigree metalwork that forms swirling, vine-like patterns across its surface. The decanter has a matching gold-colored base and a decorative stopper with a crown-like finial. It is resting on a wooden surface, with the blurred background suggesting a bar or study setting. The overall aesthetic is one of luxury and fantasy, resembling a potion bottle or a container for a rare, expensive spirit.
